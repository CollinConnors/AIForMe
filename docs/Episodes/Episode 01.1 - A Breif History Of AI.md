    # Episode 01.1 Homework Problems

    ## 011.1: The Turing Test

    **Background:**  
    In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the Imitation Game—now known as the Turing Test—as a way to evaluate whether a machine could exhibit behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. This activity explores whether modern AI systems can pass this test in practice.

    **Instructions:**  
    Split into groups of three and assign the following roles:

    - Interrogator: creates a list of five questions  
    - Human: answers the questions without using AI tools  
    - Chatbot: uses an assigned large language model (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, MetaAI, DeepSeek, Claude)

    The Interrogator will email the questions to the Human and the Chatbot. Each participant will respond independently. Groups will create two slides showing the questions and both sets of answers.

    Prepare a short report that includes:

    - The five questions used by the Interrogator  
    - The Human responses  
    - The AI-generated responses  
    - The group’s determination of which participant was the human and which was the AI, with justification  
    - Conclude by discussing if moderen AI can pass the Turing test. Do we have a definitive answer to Turings "Can Machines Think?" question?

    ## 011.2: The Weakness of the Perceptron and the XOR Problem

    **Background:**  
    The perceptron is an early model of an artificial neuron that can only represent linearly separable functions. The XOR problem is a classic example that demonstrates a fundamental limitation of single-layer perceptrons.

    **Instructions:**  
    XOR takes two binary inputs and outputs `1` if the inputs are different and `0` if they are the same. The input–output pairs are:
    - (0,0) → 0  
    - (0,1) → 1  
    - (1,0) → 1  
    - (1,1) → 0  

    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

    - A diagram showing the four XOR input points on a two-dimensional coordinate plane  
    - An attempt to separate the two classes using a single straight line  
    - An explanation of whether such a separation is possible  
    - A brief discussion of what this limitation implies about single-layer perceptrons  

    ---

    ## 011.3: ELIZA vs. Modern Chatbots

    **Background:**  
    ELIZA, developed in the 1960s, was one of the first programs to simulate conversation using simple pattern matching. Comparing ELIZA to modern AI systems highlights key advances in natural language processing.

    **Instructions:**  
    Review the paper by (Wizenbaum)[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/365153.365168]. Interact with an online ELIZA chatbot using a variety of factual, emotional, and open-ended prompts. Then interact with a modern chatbot such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT using similar prompts.

    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

    - Try to recreate the converstion that Weizenbaum has with ELIZA on page 1 of the paper with both ELIZA and a modern chatbot
    - Come up with your own line of 5 questions to ask both ELIZA and a modern chatbot
    - Observations about differences in understanding and relevance  
    - Discuss the strengths and limitations of ELIZA despite its simplicity  
    - Ways in which modern AI systems demonstrate advancement  

    Your report should include screenshots of your converstaions with both ELIZA and the modern chatbot. 

    ---

    ## 011.4: AI Rivalries

    **Background:**  
    Intellectual rivalries and disagreements have played a significant role in shaping the history of artificial intelligence. These debates often influenced research priorities and theoretical approaches.

    **Instructions:**  
    Choose one historical AI rivalry discussed in lecture.

    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

    - A summary of each side’s perspective  
    - The core points of disagreement between the rivals  
    - Which argument you find more convincing and why  
    - How the rivalry influenced the development of AI  
    - Lessons this debate offers for AI research today  

    ---

    ## 011.5: Optimism, Pessimism, and the Future of AI

    **Background:**  
    Prominent figures in artificial intelligence hold sharply different views about AI’s future. Demis Hassabis has expressed an optimistic perspective, emphasizing AI’s potential to accelerate scientific discovery and benefit humanity. In contrast, Geoffrey Hinton has raised serious concerns about loss of control, misuse, and catastrophic risks associated with advanced AI systems. These perspectives frame an ongoing debate about whether AI will ultimately be beneficial or dangerous.

    **Instructions:**  
    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

    - A summary of Demis Hassabis’s optimistic view of the future of AI  
    - A summary of Geoffrey Hinton’s pessimistic view of the future of AI  
    - Your assessment of which direction you believe AI development is currently heading and why  
    - Actions governments could take to encourage beneficial AI outcomes  
    - Actions model developers and AI companies could take to reduce risk and promote safety  
    - Actions researchers could take to advance responsible AI development  
    - Actions users could take to use AI systems responsibly  
    - Actions or failures by any of these groups that could increase the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes, including P(doom)    

    ---

    ## 011.6: Can AI Think?

    **Background:**  
    Alan Turing’s question “Can machines think?” remains central to debates in artificial intelligence, philosophy, and cognitive science.

    **Instructions:**  
    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

    - Your definition of what it means to “think”  
    - A summary of Turing’s Imitation Game  
    - Whether you agree with Turing’s approach and why  
    - A comparison between a modern chatbot you have used and Turing’s vision  
    - Your conclusion on whether machines can think, supported by examples  

    ---

    ## 011.7: How Games Changed AI

    **Background:**  
    Games have historically served as important benchmarks for AI progress because they provide controlled environments with clear goals and measurable outcomes.

    **Instructions:**  
    Choose a game discussed in lecture or another approved example.

    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

    - Why the game was chosen as a test of AI capability  
    - What strategies or insights the AI system developed  
    - Whether the AI’s performance surprised experts  
    - A modern game you would propose for AI research and why it presents a meaningful challenge
