    # Episode 00.1 Homework Problems

    ## 001.1: AI Ethics and Disclosure

    **Background:**  
    As AI tools become more capable and accessible, questions of ethics, transparency, and disclosure have become increasingly important. The appropriate use of AI varies by context, and failing to disclose AI assistance can raise concerns related to trust, accountability, and fairness.

    **Instructions:**  
    Reflect on the ethical implications of using AI tools in different contexts, including academic settings, business or professional environments, and personal life. Consider situations where using AI may be inappropriate, misleading, or harmful, even if it is technically allowed. Additionally, evaluate whether individuals should disclose their use of AI.

    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:

      - Examples of situations where using AI would be unethical in school, even if the tool is approved  
      - Examples of situations where AI use may be unethical or misleading in business or professional contexts  
      - Examples from everyday life where AI use could create ethical concerns
      - Your position on AI disclosure requirements, including:

        - When disclosure should be mandatory, optional, or unnecessary? 
        - What professions (if any) should be required to disclose AI use in their work? 
        - What professions (if any) should not be required to disclose AI use in their work? 
        - What meaningful disclosure should look like?

    Support your arguments with clear reasoning and, where appropriate, references to ethical principles, professional standards, or real-world examples.

    ## 001.2: AI Policies Across the University

    **Background:**  
    AI usage policies can vary widely across courses, departments, and institutions. Some classes explicitly permit AI tools, others restrict their use, and many have no formal policy at all.

    **Instructions:**  
    Select one course you are currently taking (excluding this class) that has an AI Policy. Review the syllabus, course website, or ask your professor to determine whether the course has an AI usage policy. If none of your other courses have an AI Policy you may use this courses AI policy. 

    Prepare a short report that addresses the following:
    
      - Write a brief summary of what it allows or restricts, include a screenshot of the policy in your report
      - Review the University of Miami PETAL's guidance on (Teaching and Learing with AI)[https://petal.miami.edu/teaching-guides-and-policies/teaching-and-learning-with-ai/]
      - How does the AI policy of your selected class compare to PETAL's recommendation?
      - Search the internet for another University's recommendations on AI Policy. How does it compare to the Universitiy of Miami's policy? You should include refrences to the other university's policy in your report.
      - From the perspective of the professor, what concerns or goals should shape an AI policy (e.g., learning outcomes, assessment integrity, workload)  
      - From the perspective of a university administrator, what risks or obligations should influence policy decisions (e.g., academic integrity, legal compliance, equity)  
      - From your perspective as a student, what is an effective and fair AI policy
      - Conclude by proposing a clear, concise AI policy for one of your courses that does not have an AI policy. Explain why you belive the policy is apporpriate for the class you selected.

    ## 001.3: AI in the News Practice

    **Background:**  
    Artificial intelligence is frequently discussed in news and scholarly media, often highlighting new capabilities, risks, policies, or societal impacts. Engaging with credible reporting helps connect course concepts to real-world developments and public discourse.

    **Instructions:**  
    Using one of the University Library news sources provided in the References section, locate a recent article that focuses on artificial intelligence. Choose an article that you find interesting or relevant to your academic, professional, or personal interests.

    Prepare a short written response (1–2 paragraphs) that addresses the following:

      - A clear summary of the article’s main points
      - An explanation of why you chose this article
      - A discussion of how the article relates to topics covered in this course
      - Your own thoughts, questions, or reactions to the article

    Be sure your response reflects your understanding of both the article and the course material.

    ## 001.4: Final Project Topic Brainstorm

    **Background:**  
    The final project for this course will be a poster that explores an application of artificial intelligence in a domain related to your own academic, professional, or personal interests. AI is being applied across nearly every field, from science and engineering to the arts, business, healthcare, and everyday life. Selecting a topic that genuinely interests you will make the project more engaging and meaningful.

    **Instructions:**  
    Begin brainstorming possible topics for your final project poster. Consider how AI is currently used, or could reasonably be used in the near future, within different areas of your life.

    Prepare a short written response that includes the following:

      - A list of five potential AI application topics related to school (e.g., a major, coursework, research interests)
      - A list of five potential AI application topics related to work (e.g., current or past jobs, internships, career goals)
      - A list of five potential AI application topics related to life (e.g., hobbies, health, creativity, daily routines, social issues)

    For each topic, include a brief explanation of why it would make a strong and interesting choice for a final project poster (e.g., relevance, impact, personal interest, or connection to course themes).

    Your response should focus on exploration and idea generation rather than selecting a single final topic.
